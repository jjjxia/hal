Native algorithm recovery (migration in progress)
================================================

This plugin is being ported from algorithm_recovery/invfold and the separately
preserved firmware adapter. Its current command is RAM extraction. The C++ API
also implements observed-period folding and coupled frame execution. The full
netlist-to-algorithm pipeline is not yet migrated. See
algorithm_recovery/CPP_MIGRATION_STATE.txt.

Build from the HAL repository root:

  cmake -S . -B build -DPL_ALGORITHM_RECOVERY=ON \
    -DPL_SEQUENTIAL_SYMBOLIC_EXECUTION=ON -DPL_Z3_UTILS=ON \
    -DALGORITHM_RECOVERY_TESTS=ON
  cmake --build build --target hal-recover check-recovery-memory \
    check-recovery-ram-extraction check-recovery-folding \
    check-recovery-folding-fixture -j 4

Extract RAM metadata and symbolic port equations from an imported HAL netlist:

  HAL_BASE_PATH="$PWD/build" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/lib" \
    build/bin/hal_plugins/hal-recover extract-ram input.hal output.json

The native plugin calls HAL SSE directly. No Python interpreter, script, original
RTL names, grouping table, or observed address schedule is invoked by this path.
HAL's shared plugin infrastructure itself links Python libraries; this is not a
claim that the entire HAL distribution has no Python build/link dependencies.

Supported memory: SB_RAM40_4K, READ_MODE=WRITE_MODE=0, primary-input rising-edge
clocks, concrete hexadecimal bit_vector INIT parameters, LUT/carry cones with
FF/RAM output cutpoints. Unsupported modes, missing pins/parameters, unknown
INIT bits, and unsupported cone cells return explicit errors. Other architectures
are not covered by this primitive adapter. All eight port functions remain
symbolic. Pin lists and expression net_ID_0 symbols refer to native HAL net IDs.
No claim of logical RAM bank recovery is made.

step_ram implements synchronous held read data, independent clock enables,
inverted per-bit write mask and read-before-write simultaneous edges. RamState's
initial read=0 is one explicit two-state choice for the uninitialized output
register, not inferred hardware initialization. The cell's storage INIT is
extracted exactly; no trace contents substitute for it.

Independent primitive regression (requires iverilog and Yosys cells_sim.v):

  ctest --test-dir build/plugins/algorithm_recovery --output-on-failure

This test runs 512 events with arbitrary nonzero INIT, independent read/write
edges, held reads, collisions, full/partial masks and high address bits. It
compares native outputs and final storage with the actual Yosys primitive, and
requires three deliberately wrong transition rules to disagree.

Real-case migration regression (local artifacts are intentionally not tracked):

  HAL_BASE_PATH="$PWD/build" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/lib" \
    build/bin/hal_plugins/check-recovery-ram-extraction \
    ordered.hal native_ram.json recovered.json

The last two inputs are test evidence only. This regression checks exact pins,
clocks and INIT, then proves equality of each native port expression against
the previously validated Python adapter's expression with Z3. SAT and UNKNOWN
both fail the equality check. It also checks rejection of unsupported modes
and unknown INIT. This is migration equivalence of RAM extraction, not a new
independent whole-device proof. The .hal inputs were produced by the previous
Python frontend; raw recovered.json import is still to be migrated.

Native folding API (include/algorithm_recovery/folding.h):

  fold_observed(FoldInput, context) -> FoldGraph
  initial_memories(FoldGraph, initial_read) -> extracted power-up RAM state
  run_frame(FoldGraph, history, boundary_inputs, warmed_RAM_state, context)

FoldInput contains HAL-derived groups in physical storage coordinates, effective
D equations including reset, observed physical write classifications and a
contiguous extraction window. Primitive bit symbols are packed into words in
C++ without introducing numeric bit orders. Unknown, mixed, inactive and
nonperiodic words remain explicit boundary inputs. Period detection checks the
entire window. Construction requires one real prefix and three repetitions;
last writes are resolved strictly before the reading event and checked in all
three repetitions. Too short a common-period window returns available=false.
This is an observed-period contract, not an unbounded schedule certificate.

RAM read outputs are internal state endpoints. RAM ports retain symbolic data
and control dependencies resolved through the same graph. Every RAM port is
evaluated before any memory is updated, and FF nodes sample pre-event reads.
The raw native executor uses Z3's fixed-width evaluator and accepts words wider
than machine integers; missing or wrong-width boundary state fails explicitly.
It does not invoke Python. Power-up RAM state must be warmed to the graph origin
before real-case replay; initial_memories does not perform that warmup.

check-recovery-folding exercises wide-word recurrence against independent
integer arithmetic, actual last writes, held/mixed/nonperiodic words, insufficient
windows and two coupled RAMs. These tests are included in the CTest command above.

Real-case folding migration regression:

  build/bin/hal_plugins/check-recovery-folding-fixture CASE_DIRECTORY recovered.json

Only this test adapter reads the old native_sse.json/native_ram.json artifacts;
they are converted to the typed production API. The folder does not read an old
graph or invoke the old InvFold. The test then compares all seven existing graphs
across the two cases: periods, origins, every FF node's source bindings and
universally equivalent expression, history entries and every RAM port binding.
It also checks the HMD pattern's existing NO_GRAPH outcome. This does not yet
verify a newly migrated trace/SSE frontend or real-case frame replay.

Arithmetic fitting with universal checks, routing-order inference and standalone
program export remain required migration steps; the raw executor is not a
replacement for those capabilities.
